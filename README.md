# AIRLINES-MANAGEMENT-SMART-SYSTEM
Database Management Assignment 2nd Semester 2020-21


The Airline industry is booming with over 144 million customers in the year 2019. One of the most crucial elements which the Airline industry depends upon is the Database Management System for every Airline, which is used to store, organize and retrieve the details of all the Staff, Passenger bookings, Airline and Aircraft details, Arrivals, Departures, Finances, and many more segments.
 This requires a robust and efficient design of the Database to manage the data so that it can be accessed, modified, and stored quickly, and in the least space. A DBMS may also be called a “Transaction Processing System”. A transaction is the basic atomic unit of a DBMS and hundreds of transactions take place every minute concurrently. A transaction may be a Search, Delete, Update or Insert operation into the database.
The Database system and SQL commands described in this report makes up the basic operations of the airline such as reservation, cancellation, and updating of a flight trip data. 

These are the following risks as per our analysis:    

Resource availability: • Are the necessary skilled staff and computation available to develop this system? 

Development Risk: • Can a system be developed so that it satisfies the pre-decided operational benchmarks and limits?

Technology: • Has the technology progressed to a state that will support the system?

Our answer is that Yes, we currently are able to account for these risks in a proper manner. The resources that are needed to develop this system are present with us, we are the only staff who are working on this project, and we are satisfied that we will manage to execute this project within the given constraints with our current programming ability.
